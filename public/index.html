            <h1>Alexander's Favorite Band</h1>

                <p>
                    My favorite band of all time without a doubt is Linkin Park. I started listening to them at a very early age with some YouTube videos. I like their melody and that it is a different style of rock, and definitely what I love the most is the magnificent voice of Chester Bennington.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The band had gathered in the 90s, however, they released their first album called "Hybrid Theory" in the early 2000s, where it became an immediate success, gaining a large fan base in such a short time and being one of the best debut albums in history. I was not very aware of what Chester Bennington’s death meant in 2017, due to a depression that haunted him all his life and was reflected in each song.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After his death, I felt the void of that vocalist known as the angel with the demon voice. The band did not release more music until the 20th anniversary of the album *Meteora*, when, against all odds, they released a new song in 2023, about six years after Chester's death. The song was considered lost; it was called *"Lost."*
                </p>
                <p>
                    I remember this song with great affection. I was in class when notifications of a new Linkin Park song came out everywhere. I thought it was a joke, but when I entered the official channel, I saw it. I put on headphones and listened to it in the classic Linkin Park style, and suddenly I heard Chester's voice. At that moment, I started to cry. It had been many years since I heard his voice. It was something historic for all the fans of the band. The video was a tribute to the edited videos that made them famous, and the recreation of Chester was magnificent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They gave us joy, but nothing was set in stone about whether they would return—until September 5th, when, during a live concert, they presented the band's reunion and a new album alongside Emily Armstrong, the new vocalist. At first, I couldn't get used to how she could be the one to take Chester's place, but she proved to be the right choice.

        <h2>My Favorite Albums:</h2>

                <h3>Hybrid Theory</h3>
                <p>
                    "Hybrid Theory" is the album that started it all. It contains some of their most famous songs like "In the End," "One Step Closer," and "Crawling." The album mixes rock, electronica, and rap. The lyrics cover various topics but often focus on Chester's teenage struggles.
                </p>

            <div class="box">
                <div class="small-image"><img src="/IMG/Img2.jpg" alt="One More Light Album Cover"></div>
                <h3>One More Light</h3>
                <p>
                    The most sentimental album, "One More Light," saw the band shift away from rock toward a more pop-oriented sound. It was the last album released before Chester's death, and it reflects his battle with depression.
                </p>

                <h3>From Cero</h3>
                <p>
                    The first album released after Chester's death. The album is still somewhat of a mystery, with only two songs released so far: "The Empire’s Machine" and "Heavy is the Crown." Opinions are divided on the album, but I believe it marks a new chapter for the band, one Chester would have been proud of.
